### The Data Science Agile Project Wheel (2015.01.18) 
I am super excited about completing my first week at 
[Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/).

We learned so much about Data Science.  Bo Peng's awsome presentation on the Design Process of Data Science inspired me to explore an agile approach to Data Science.  So I employed my cat, my hamster, and his hamster ball to explain it all.  More on that below.

For our first Metis project we analyzed MTA Turnstile Data (and other data) to optimize street team performance for a client.
